   <h3> Projects at GWC</h3>
 
   <b> Obamicon</b>
      <p>This project was really fun and challenging. We had to choose any regular image and turn the pixels to get the image in a another color
         such as red,blue,and yellow. It was frustrating because I couldn't find the right code so the color could go to every pixels without knowing each number of the pixels. 
         It took me about 2 hours to figure it out but I got it!. I used variables in this project by having intensity of the pixels and of course for loops 
         that can be able to run through every pixel in the image. We had lists as well such as the image list.</p>
  
   <b>Draw shapes</b>
      <p>I was only able to do this project in scratch because I missed it on python. But this was one of the many challenges for me
         because I just started out. I was getting frustarted why I couldn'y figure it out myself because computer science is what I want to do
         and I guess sometimes I won't be able to do it good enough. Although this project involved a lot of critical thinking and using basic math.
         I learned about user input's and how you have to have a code that is not specific but can stil run and do the job. Such as if the user input any number 
         so that the computer can draw that shape that the user suggested by number of sides.</p>

   <b>Side scroller</b>
      <p>During this project it was a bit difficult to choose a topic for the game I had to create along with my teammate but then we 
         combined our interets together and came up with PawBoard. We use a lot of loops to get the illusion of a side scrolling screen or 
         that the charater is moving but it is actually in one place. This was one of the projects that needed more time to work on because I still
         got it to function but not well enough. There were so imperfections such as the score board and assigning the charater to jump up over obstacles. 
         So we didn't have many functions or variables because we didn't go that further with the game like not any more levels.</p>
